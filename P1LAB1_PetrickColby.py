# Simple python script showcasing proper syntax w/ variables, input and print function
#Using firstname and lastname as variables - They are descriptive of the info being gathered.
print('Enter your First Name:', end=' ') #Using end function to keep input on same line
firstname = input()
print('Enter your Last Name:', end=' ')
lastname = input()

print('Hello,', firstname, lastname + '!', 'Welcome to CTI-110')

'''
Concatenated the Lastname with ! to get the same effect as image.
This was trialed 7 times before no issues where noticed in output - another 3 times with different inputs
just to be safe
